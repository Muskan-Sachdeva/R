# Genomic Data Visualization – R Scripts

This repository contains a collection of R scripts I use to visualize various types of genomic data.  
The goal is to create clear, publication-quality plots for genome analysis, comparative genomics, pangenomics, repeat annotation, and other bioinformatics workflows.

##  Contents
- Scripts for BUSCO visualizations  
- Genome assembly quality plots    
- Repeat content plots  
- Gene/annotation-based visualizations  
- Custom ggplot2 themes for clean scientific figures  

Each script is written to be modular, easy to reuse, and suitable for generating figures for research projects.

## 🧬 Tools & Libraries Used
- **R**, **RStudio**
- **tidyverse**
- **ggplot2**
- **dplyr**
- **tidyr**
- **readr**
- **patchwork**

## Purpose
This repository is created to provide reproducible R workflows for visualizing key genomic features—such as assembly quality, repeat content, gene annotations, k-mer profiles, and BUSCO completeness—supporting downstream analysis and research.
